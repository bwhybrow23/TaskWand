## Hello

TaskWand is a powerful web-based task management application that helps you stay organized and productive. With TaskWand, you can create tasks, set due dates, add descriptions, and assign priority levels. You can also mark tasks as complete or delete them when they're no longer needed.

TaskWand comes packed with features to make task management easy and efficient. You can filter your tasks by status or priority level, sort them by due date or priority level, and receive notifications for upcoming or overdue tasks. With TaskWand, you'll never miss a deadline or forget an important task again.

TaskWand is built using Node.js and Express.js on the server-side, with MongoDB as the database. It uses EJS as the templating engine and Bootstrap as the front-end framework. 
<!-- TaskWand is deployed on Heroku for easy access and use. -->
